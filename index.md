Welcome to the UV-K5(8) / UV-K6 Quick Start Guide!

A quick summary of the goals of this site.
As of January 2025 I purchased a Quansheng UV-K5(8). After a little googling and searching the internet I learned about the potential for upgrading and customizing this radio. Not to mention it's low price, I felt like this would be a great way to spend some time in the cold months in Boston MA.

Once I finally figured out how to save the initial configuration of the radio _which in itself took time to find_,  I proceeded to figure out which of all the existing firmwares was the one people were mostly using. Then when I found that, learning the relevent settings and how to configure them was not easy.

In all of this, it's not that the technical data is hard to understand, but there was no top-down authoritative and well structured documentation..
