# How should I start using my radio?

When addressing more novice users for how to use such a complicated device like an HT, it's hard to know where to start. As I've been scanning the online forums and looking out for what new users post, I think I can break down users into two main use cases:

1) I just want to listen to civil and other services, and use the UV-K5 as a scanner.
2) I want to communicate with other people with my UV-K5.

## Using the UV-K5 For listening only

Many people use HTs (Handheld Transceivers) like the Quansheng UV-K5 purely for listening, without ever transmitting. This is legal, safe, and a fantastic way to get familiar with radio communications before diving into licensing. Remember: 

* In most places (like the U.S.), you do not need a license to listen.
* Some frequencies (like certain emergency bands) are illegal to listen to in some statesâ€”check local laws.

The UV-K5 can be used for a variety of listening including

* FM radio
* NOAA Weather radio
* Emergency Services (Police, Fire, EMS)
* Air traffic control
* Local Municipal departments
* 2 meter or 70 cm bands of amateur radio, used for communication by the local hams

It's not too hard to listen in to most of these services. The three steps you need are:

1) Update your firmware
2) Configure chirp for the UV-K5
3) Create and update chirp with your local frequencies and other operation parameters
4) Send the configuration to your radio

You can then create scan lists so that your radio cycles through all the frequencies you're interested in and stops any time there's a transmission.

## Using the UV-K5 for talking to other hams

Most important is that if you want to talk to other people or transmit any communication on your UN-K5, you need a license (e.g., ham Technician class). In the USA you will need to study for and take a test presented by ARRL. You can learn more about licensure and radio education at [this link](https://www.arrl.org/licensing-education-training). By virtue of learning the required electronics and radio theory, so much about the UV-K5 makes sense. It's best to go all-in on the hobby, however if you only want to listen as explained above you can still get pretty far just by following a few procedures and setting up your radio.

Transmitting with your UV-K5 builds on all the steps above. You will have to take step 3 further by customizing radio presets with additional information for the transmission piece. Our radios provide lots of information about their operation which is really informative for hams, so as you level up and learn to transmit, knowing about everything going on and tweaking small parameters becomes part of the fun.
